About This Project:
This project was created to address some of the user experience challenges of using trademap.org. For example, users have to click multiple times to create a simple geographic visualization of Bangladesh's trading partners. In this redesigned version of the map, user do not have click as much and can navigate between the maps using the three buttons on the top right. The main goal of this project was to present the users with the option to navigate between Bangladesh's trade data in a clean and a simple interface. I am a frequent user of the trademaps.org and I find it incredibly difficult to navigate between the menus and the process of creating your own visualization can be very challenging. Additionally, it is very difficult to view multiple datapoint at once. 

Methodology:
The data for this project was obtained from trademaps.org and cartographic and user experience methodologies were applied to rethink and redesign the presentation of the data points.The redesigned version of the map showcase several trade related data points at the same time and user do not have to rely on clicking as much. I envision this designed can be scaled up to include other countries in the data set and users can use filters to navigate between country data sets. 

Map Description:
Globally, Bangladesh’s economy is currently ranked 32nd largest in terms of purchasing power parity (PPP). The current population stands close to 160 million and the nation has a gross domestic product (GDP) of $172 billion USD. In the year 2014, Bangladesh traded with 146 countries across the globe. Exports in 2014 totaled at around $34 billion USD and total imports were around $39 billion USD, which resulted in a trade deficit of around $6 Billion USD. Bangladesh is projected to reach a growth rate of 7.1% for the year 2016. Over the last 10 years, Bangladesh has constantly performed at an average growth rate of 6%. Majority of Bangladesh’s growth has taken place due to the presence of the rapidly growing ready made garments & textiles sectors, which exports all across the major OECD nations.
